## DBManager for Processing

DBManager for Processing is a tool add-in for the [Processing Development Enviroment (PDE)](https://processing.org/reference/environment/) framework (similar to the one with Netbeans or Eclipse).

The manager works with [Java DB](http://docs.oracle.com/javadb/) (Derby) databases. Java DB is included in the Java SDK since Java 6.0, so it is already included in Processing sketches with no additional downloads required, and may be embedded in a sketch as a local or remote server. By installing DBManager in the PDE as a tool it can be accessed concurrently from all processes working in the same Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as the database.

This project can be found on [github.com/vesolba/DBManager-for-Processing/](https://github.com/vesolba/DBManager-for-Processing/), and is based on the [Processing Tool Template](https://github.com/processing/processing-tool-template). It is developed using [Eclipse Oxygen](https://projects.eclipse.org/releases/oxygen) with the [WindowBuilder](https://eclipse.org/windowbuilder/) plug-in.
